# Web UI for ChatGPT

https://assistant.bloat.app

Ask questions from Open AIâ€™s ChatGPT `gpt-3.5-turbo` and `gpt-4` engines (GPT-4 requires early access).

See [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) for whatâ€™s new.

## ðŸ¤” Why?

### Compared to chat.openai.com
- GPT-3.5: Cheap token-based cost, instead of flat 20$/mo
- GPT-4: Unlimited messages
- No more logouts - OpenAI API key is stored in `localStorage`
- Can be added to the phoneâ€™s home screen or installed on your computer as a Chrome app
- OpenAIâ€™s API policy says your prompts wonâ€™t be used for developing, unlike in the playground

### Compared to many other ChatGPT wrappers
- No backend server â€“ requests go directly from the browser to OpenAI
- [Very polished UI](https://github.com/felixbade/chatgpt-web-ui/issues?q=label%3AUI+is%3Aclosed), especially for mobile.
- PWA support

## ðŸšš In the future
- Customize the assistantâ€™s behind-the-scenes brief
- Search old chats with GPT embeddings (meaning your search words donâ€™t need to be an exact match)
- Speak your messages using the Whisper API

## ðŸ‘€ Hidden features
- You can open the assistant with an initial prompt if you want to make integrations into other apps. Example: [https://assistant.bloat.app/#q=hello%20there](https://assistant.bloat.app/#q=hello%20there).
- You can change the model with ctrl+M.
